Introduction
------------

DoX is a feature-packed to-do list application in Python.  This repo provides the API backbone, allowing other applications to use it.

In order to make the API accessible to applications, you can either move (or symlink) the DoX folder inside of the application's root folder, or install DoX as a Python module by moving it to your Python installation's `site-packages` folder.
